* Lonnrot

A Racket implementation of a compiler for a subset of Scheme that's extended with
miniKanren. It follows, among many tutorials and references, *CMSC 430's*
/Design and Implementation of Programming Languages/ course, *Abdulaziz Ghuloum's* writings
on incremental compiler construction and *Kent Dybvig's* ideas on the same topic.

** Contents
- Sources, in =src/=, are Racket files that contain the implementation of Lonnrot
- A written report, in =report/=, which is a \LaTeX{} document, a bibliography file and
  its output pdf. This will be updated over the course of the semester.
  Acknowledgements and citations are found in this report.
- A =log.org= file, with the changelog. This is a course requirement, not that interesting
  (unless you want to accurately trace how I lose my sanity)
