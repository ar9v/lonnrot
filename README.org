* Lonnrot

[[file:report/lonnrot-logo.png]]

Lonnrot is a Racket implementation of a subset of Scheme for Linux.
It follows, among many tutorials and references,
*CMSC 430 (/Design and Implementation of Programming Languages/)*,
*Abdulaziz Ghuloum's* writings on incremental compiler construction and
*Kent Dybvig's* ideas on the same topic.


** Installation
*** Dependencies
Make sure to have =gcc= and =nasm=. Likewise, you should have Racket installed with
=megaparsack= and =a86=:

#+begin_src bash
raco pkg install 'https://github.com/cmsc430/www.git?path=langs#main'
raco pkg install megaparsack
#+end_src

*** Install script (WIP)
Once you have met the required dependencies, clone the repository and run =make=.

#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/argvniyx/lonnrot.git
cd lonnrot && make
#+end_src

** Contents
- Sources, in =src/=, are Racket files that contain the implementation of Lonnrot.
- Tests, in =test/=, which are simply Lonnrot programs that demonstrate features.
- A written report, in =report/=, which is a \LaTeX{} document, a bibliography file and
  its output pdf. This will be updated over the course of the semester.
  Acknowledgements and citations are found in this report.
