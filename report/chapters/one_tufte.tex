\chapter{Tetragrammaton}\label{ch:one}

\epigraph{The s-expression syntax dates back to 1960. This syntax is often controversial amongst programmers. Observe, however, something deeply valuable that it gives us. While parsing traditional languages can be very complex,
  parsing this syntax is virtually trivial.}{Shriram Krishnamurthi~\cite{krishnamurthi20}}

% Mention we won't deal with strings for now
% Mention anyChar is literally any char preceded by a backslash since the grammar does not include it, digit is 0 to 9
